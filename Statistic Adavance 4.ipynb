    "#### Type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected even though it is true. This means that the researcher concludes that there is a significant difference or effect when there is actually none in the population. The probability of making a Type 1 error is denoted by alpha, and it is typically set at a predetermined level (e.g., 0.05 or 0.01) before conducting the hypothesis test. An example scenario for Type 1 error is a drug trial where the null hypothesis is that the drug does not have any effect, and the alternative hypothesis is that the drug has an effect. If the researchers conclude that the drug has an effect, but it actually does not, then it is a Type 1 error.\n",

This means that the researcher fails to conclude that there is a significant difference or effect when there is actually one in the population.

An example scenario for Type 2 error is a medical test where the null hypothesis is that the patient is healthy, and the alternative hypothesis is that the patient is sick. If the test results indicate that the patient is healthy, but the patient is actually sick, then it is a Type 2 error.\n",
