    "#### Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with estimating the value of a population parameter based on a sample statistic. The goal of estimation is to use the information obtained from a sample to make inferences about the population from which the sample was drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### There are two types of estimation in statistics: point estimation and interval estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Point estimate is a single value that is used to estimate the unknown parameter of the population. It is calculated using a sample statistic, such as the sample mean or sample proportion, and is used to estimate the corresponding population parameter, such as the population mean or population proportion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example, suppose we want to estimate the average height of adult males in a population. We take a sample of 100 men and calculate their average height, which is 175 cm. This sample mean of 175 cm is a point estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Interval estimate, on the other hand, is a range of values that is used to estimate the unknown parameter of the population. It is calculated using the sample statistic and taking into account the variability of the sample. The range of values is called a confidence interval and provides a measure of how much uncertainty there is in the estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For example, if we want to estimate the average height of adult males in a population with 95% confidence, we would calculate a confidence interval around the point estimate. Suppose the confidence interval is (170 cm, 180 cm). This means that we are 95% confident that the true population mean height is between 170 cm and 180 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In summary, point estimate is a single value used to estimate an unknown parameter of a population, while interval estimate is a range of values used to estimate the unknown parameter, taking into account the variability of the sample."

    "#### Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make inferences about population parameters based on sample data. The method involves formulating two hypotheses: the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (Ha). The null hypothesis is typically the hypothesis of no difference or no effect, while the alternative hypothesis is the opposite.\n",

    "#### The goal of hypothesis testing is to determine whether the observed sample data provide enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.

    "#### When the population is normally distributed and the sample size is large (greater than or equal to 30), the t-distribution can be used as an approximation to the normal distribution.\n",

    "#### Overall, the t-distribution is an important tool in statistics for making inferences about population means when the sample size is small or the population standard deviation is unknown. It allows for the calculation of confidence intervals and hypothesis tests that take into account the uncertainty associated with small sample sizes."
