    "#### Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are two ways of describing the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### A Probability Mass Function (PMF) is a function that describes the probability of a discrete random variable taking on specific values. It gives the probability of each possible outcome in a discrete probability distribution. For example, consider a random variable X representing the number of heads obtained when a coin is flipped three times. The PMF of X can be given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PMF(X=0) = 1/8 PMF(X=1) = 3/8 PMF(X=2) = 3/8 PMF(X=3) = 1/8\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Here, the sum of all PMFs is equal to 1, as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### On the other hand, a Probability Density Function (PDF) is a function that describes the probability density of a continuous random variable. It describes the relative likelihood of different values of a continuous random variable. The probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values is given by the area under the PDF curve. For example, consider a continuous random variable Y representing the height of individuals in a population. The PDF of Y can be given as:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PDF(Y=y) = k(y-a)(b-y), for a <= y <= b\n",
